# i18n with Lingui

The setup already exists. Do not re-create it:

- `src/libs/locales.ts` holds the locale list (`code`, `name`, `nativeName`), `Locale`, `defaultLocale` (`"en"`) and `isLocale`. It is framework-free.
- `src/libs/i18n.ts` holds the `createLinguiStart` config and exports `useLocale`, `LocalizedLink`, `localizePath`, `isValidLocale`, `routerWithI18n`, `ensureLocale`, and re-exports from `locales.ts`.
- `routerWithI18n` wraps the router in `I18nProvider`, so `useLingui()` works in every route component, including `notFoundComponent`.
- Routes live under `src/routes/{-$locale}/`. English has no prefix (`/`); any other locale is prefixed (`/vi/...`). `{-$locale}/route.tsx` rejects unknown locales with `notFound()` and keeps i18n in sync with the URL.
- The app ships in English only: `src/locales/en.json` is the source catalog and the only one. Another language is added only when the user asks for it (the `add-locale` skill), and then has its own `src/locales/<code>.json`. Catalogs use the minimal JSON format, and **the message ID is the English source text**.
- Even with English alone, every visible string goes through Lingui, so a language can be added later without touching components.

## Rule 1: every visible string goes through `i18n._()`

In components, always:

```tsx
import { useLingui } from "@lingui/react";

function NotFound() {
	const { i18n } = useLingui();
	return <h1>{i18n._("404 - Page not found")}</h1>;
}
```

This covers text nodes, `placeholder`, `title`, `alt`, `aria-label`, `sr-only` spans, tooltip content and dialog titles.

Do not use the `t` macro or `<Trans>`, and do not call `msg` inside a component body. The convention is `useLingui()` from `@lingui/react` plus `i18n._(...)`. The argument is either a string literal (Rule 2) or a module-level `msg` descriptor (Rule 3).

## Rule 2: the argument is a string literal

The extractor only sees literals. The first argument must be the full English sentence written inline.

```tsx
// Correct
i18n._("{left} of {count, plural, one {# todo} other {# todos}} left", { left, count: todos.length });
i18n._("Done: {title}", { title: todo.title });

// Wrong: not extractable
i18n._(`${left} left`);
i18n._(label);
i18n._(left + " left");
```

- Interpolate with `{name}` placeholders and a values object.
- A count that changes the words uses ICU plural inside the message: `i18n._("{count, plural, one {# post} other {# posts}}", { count })`. Never pick between two messages with `count === 1 ? … : …`: other languages have other plural forms.
- Keep whole sentences in one message. Never concatenate translated fragments, because word order differs between languages (Japanese and Thai especially).
- Punctuation and ellipses (`…`) belong inside the message.

## Rule 3: labels declared outside components use `msg`

Labels known at module level (nav items, status maps, option lists) are declared once, outside the component, as `msg` descriptors and rendered with `i18n._(descriptor)`. `src/layouts/AppLayout.tsx` is the reference:

```tsx
import type { MessageDescriptor } from "@lingui/core";
import { msg } from "@lingui/core/macro";

const navItems = [
	{ to: "/", label: msg({ id: "Home" }) },
	{ to: "/todos", label: msg({ id: "Todos" }) },
] satisfies { to: string; label: MessageDescriptor }[];

// render, with a stable, untranslated key:
{navItems.map((item) => (
	<LocalizedLink key={item.to} to={item.to}>{i18n._(item.label)}</LocalizedLink>
))}
```

For maps keyed by a domain union, use `satisfies Record<Union, MessageDescriptor>`. A new value without a label then fails typecheck:

```ts
export const statusLabels = {
	open: msg({ id: "Open" }),
	done: msg({ id: "Done" }),
} satisfies Record<TodoStatus, MessageDescriptor>;
```

- A list used by one component stays at the top of that component's file. Shared label maps go in a `labels.ts` next to the feature.
- `msg({ id: "..." })` takes a literal, same as Rule 2. Never build IDs dynamically.
- The `msg` macro is compiled by `lingui({ macroTransform: true })` in `vite.config.ts`. Keep that option.

## Rule 4: numbers, money, percent, dates

Lingui's `i18n.number` and `i18n.date` are deprecated. Use `src/libs/intl.ts`, which wraps `Intl` with the active locale and caches formatters:

```tsx
import { formatCurrency, formatDate, formatNumber, formatPercent } from "#/libs/intl";

const { i18n } = useLingui();
formatDate(i18n.locale, todo.createdAt);                              // October 22, 2026
formatDate(i18n.locale, ts, { dateStyle: "medium", timeStyle: "short" });
formatNumber(i18n.locale, count);
formatCurrency(i18n.locale, price);                                   // USD by default; pass { currency }
formatPercent(i18n.locale, 0.024, { maximumFractionDigits: 1 });      // ratio in, "2.4%" out
```

- `formatDate` defaults to `timeZone: "UTC"` so server and browser render the same text and hydration does not mismatch. Override `timeZone` only in client-only UI.
- `th` uses the Buddhist calendar year by default (`2569`). Pass a locale like `th-TH-u-ca-gregory` if Gregorian years are required.
- Never hand-build strings like `` `$${n.toFixed(2)}` ``. `Intl` output can contain non-breaking spaces (U+00A0), so do not compare formatted strings against plain spaces in tests.

## Rule 5: what is not translated

- What users type (todo titles and other stored data): it is shown as it was written.
- Brand and product names (`TanStack Start`, `GitHub`), identifiers, file paths and URLs. Pass them as placeholder values (`{file}`) rather than leaving them inside the sentence when they might change.
- `nativeName` in the language switcher: it is already written in the target language.

## Rule 6: route titles and non-component code

Route `head` runs outside React, so use the router context:

```ts
head: ({ match }) => ({
	meta: [{ title: match.context.i18n._("Todos") }],
}),
```

Server functions and other non-React code receive the locale (or an `I18n` instance) as a parameter. Never import a global i18n instance, and never use `t` from `@lingui/core/macro`: during SSR it is not bound to the request locale and throws.

## Rule 7: locale-aware navigation

- Internal links use `LocalizedLink` from `#/libs/i18n` (same props as `Link`, `to` without the locale prefix): `<LocalizedLink to="/todos">`. Its `to` is typed as `string`, so check that the route exists.
- Switch language with `useLocale().switchLocale(code)` and list options from `locales`.
- Loaders read the locale from `context.locale` (URL-derived), never from the cookie.

## Workflow after changing text

From the repo root:

1. Run `bun run i18n:extract`. It adds new IDs to every catalog and removes unused ones (`--clean`). Its table shows the "Missing" count per locale.
2. When the app has other locales, fill every new key in each `src/locales/<code>.json` except `en.json`. An empty value means untranslated, and the UI then falls back to English. Keep placeholders exactly as they are (`{count}`), and keep nav and button labels short.
3. Run `bun run i18n:check`. It exits 1 if any translation is missing.
4. With other locales, check each in the browser (`/vi/...`): the text, the date formats, and the layout with longer or wider strings.

Do not edit IDs in the catalogs by hand. Change the English literal in code and re-extract. Changing an English string creates a new ID, so its translations must be redone in every catalog.

To add or remove a language, use the `add-locale` skill. It also covers the language switcher and the two-letter code rule.

## Checklist

- [ ] No hardcoded visible string, placeholder, alt or aria-label in the diff.
- [ ] Every `i18n._()` argument is a complete English literal or a module-level `msg` descriptor; label maps use `satisfies`.
- [ ] Placeholders instead of concatenation; one sentence per message.
- [ ] Numbers, money, percent and dates go through `#/libs/intl`.
- [ ] Links use `LocalizedLink`.
- [ ] `bun run i18n:check` passes (no empty values in any catalog).
